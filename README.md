# vimeo-live-player-examples
This simple application demonstrates how to use Vimeo Live M3U8 links with a third-party player like [JWPlayer](https://jwplayer.com).

## Prerequisites
- Access to the Vimeo [Live API](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/live), only available to Enterprise customers. Learn more about [Vimeo Enterprise](https://vimeo.com/enterprise?mkc=liveapi).
- A Vimeo API [access token](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/guides/start#generate-access-token) with the minimum scopes `public private`
- A free [JWPlayer](https://jwplayer.com) account and a [new player](https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/list).
- Your JWPlayer Cloud Player Library URL, found [here](https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/downloads).

**WARNING**: Executing this app client-side exposes your Vimeo API auth token. To avoid that security risk, run this app in a privte environment.
